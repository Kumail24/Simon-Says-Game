# Simon-Says-Game
Arduino memory game which challenges user to replicate a sequence of flashing LEDs, with sequence getting longer after each round. This game includes visual cues for when a round is successfully completed or when a round is failed.

If a round is successfully completed, all 4 LEDS will flash in unison once.

If a round is failed, the user's first mistakenly pressed LED in the sequence will flash 3 times.
